罗素生前最后受BBC采访时说的话	

​	I should like to say 2 things, one is intellectual and one moral. 

​	The intellectual thing I should want to say to them is this, when you are studying any matter or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out. Never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe, or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed. But look only, and solely, at what are the facts. That is the intellectual thing that I should wish to say. 

​	The moral thing I should wish to say to them is very simple. I should say love is wise, hatred is foolish. In this world which is getting more and more closely interconnected. we have to learn to tolerate each other, we have to learn to put up with the fact that some people say things that we don't like. We can only live together in that way and if we are to live together and not die together, we must learn a king of charity and a king of tolerance, which is absolutely vital to the continuation of human life on this planet.
